# Housing



## Construction

* Single-family houses up to 60m2
* Construction wood to be planted in equal amounts and of same type as used for construction
* Either wood or wood/natural stone construction, 90%+ natural materials, 100% non-toxic materials
* Designed for multiple generations \(100+ years of usage\) and repurposable
* Modern kitchen with higher and lower sink \(or adjustable height\)
* At least 3 rooms, e.g. bedroom, living and study \(plus kitchen and bathroom\)

## Living climate

* Near-[passive](https://hackpad.dsrp.eu/MIRiUkTvGxq#Passive-house)
* [Earthship](https://hackpad.dsrp.eu/3Bkp8Bu6bF9#Earthship)-inspired attached greenhouse for heat gathering and passive circulation
* Either locally produced wood for heating, resistive electrical low-temperature floor heating or a combination of both and/or water-source or ground-source heat pump
* Comfortably warm in winter \(&gt;19 C\), cofortambly cool in summer \(&lt;25 C\)
* Over capacitated with regards to historical climate; account for strong climate change \(both ways!\)

## Water

* Spring-fed drinking water
* Full circular [grey water](https://hackpad.dsrp.eu/FJY3DaUcCFe#Grey-water) system, including rain water capture and biofilter use

## Sanitation

Dry toilets, integrated composting.

## Energy

* Safe, low-voltage DC internal grid \(24 or 48V\) with and collective 230 V grid connection.
* Microgrid connectivity to other houses and potential communual generation and storage \(e.g. water pumps and microturbines, wind energy capture\)
* Low-water use shower, depending on local climate with [water recycling shower](https://hackpad.dsrp.eu/bDS0lhPShlr#Water-recycling-shower)

## Environment

* [Common](https://hackpad.dsrp.eu/HxuZoIaexMx) public facilities within walking distance; caf√©/library/restaurant/co-work space/yoga/meditation/studio/childcare/school/guest rooms
* Neighbour's house just about visible or just about invisible from top windows, when trees are full grown
* Residential density that would allow all people to live 'spaceous' enough for nutricious self-sufficiency
