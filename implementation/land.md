# Land

## Requirements

### Water

As we're looking for a reasonable challenge first time around \(and your home\) not level 10 difficulty, ideal is one of the traditional Portuguese [acequias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acequia). But any amount, just so long as it doesn't dry out in summer is good.

### Food

A small space near the house where we can have proper veggie patches is ideal. As the forest won't really be making diverse foods for at least the first few years.

### Materials

We'll be planting trees within each design which will be thought out to be useful in 20-500 years when the houses need rehabilitation. A small section of an existent wooded stand would be excellent. While not making financial sense right now, the future might prove different.

### Burning wood

We'll be able to plant trees that provide a year's supply of wood for heating within 5 years. Until then we'd have to buy it, but could also be taken from an existing stand if it exists.

### Non-primary needs

...

### Orientation

The ideal piece of land, is an entire mountain. So we get every possible orientation. But that's also level 7-9 of difficulty, because north expositions will be harder to get truly diversified year long yields \(but not impossible\) so maybe that's better to save for iteration 2 or 3. For the first piece of land maybe we should keep it to West and East interesting, but South necessary.

### Personal Space

We are looking for a piece of land that is large enough so that one part of it is well within the range of neighbors or the nearby houses, while the other end is isolated or somehow removed. There's times we just want head into the woods and sing where no one can hear it. Having to always worry about neighbors would be a bit constricting.
