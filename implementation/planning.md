# Planning

## Phases

In order to manage complexity and risk we will validate various assumptions in 3 phases launching at 5 year intervals. With each independent pilot lasting 15 years, the time it takes for our forests to mature, the aggregate of all 3 phases will take 25 years to complete.

The first phase will validate the forest design and the practices for collaboration and community self-organisation. The second phase will validate the market potential for processed forest-based products. And the third phase will validate learning curves, demonstrating increased efficiency and large-scale collaboration between communities.
