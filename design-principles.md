# Design Principles

## Minimal action

Based on the Taoism concept of wu wei, a concept literally meaning non-action, non-doing or non-forcing.

## Working with Nature

## Anti-fragile

> Some things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder, and stressors and love adventure, risk, and uncertainty. Yet, in spite of the ubiquity of the phenomenon, there is no word for the exact opposite of fragile. Let us call it antifragile. Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better.

## Safe to fail

Allow components to fail independently. This prevents failure cascading wherein a single failure might propagate leading to a full collapse of the system. In systems design, this is often referred to as 'designed to fail', as opposed to a fail-safe approach wherein failure is prevented at all costs.
